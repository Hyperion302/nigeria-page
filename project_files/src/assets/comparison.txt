    Nigeria and the United States have very similar government systems on paper, but in practice, they are starkly different. While the US is a fairly functional system with low levels of corruption and very high levels of economic development, Nigeria has significant trouble maintaining peace and democracy, and most citizens are still living in poverty. Nigeria has several problems that lead to this difference. For one, there are over 250 ethnic groups, which causes severe regional divisions and prevents cohesion in the national government. This lack of cohesion leads to a drop in enforcement of the rule of law, because a self conflicting government does not properly enforce it’s checks and balances. This is why corruption ends up running rampant.  For example, the Nigerian transparency rating is 27/100, similar to Russia’s and Iran’s.  Another problem for Nigeria is the presence of oil and foreign interference in the economy through unchecked vectors such as multinational corporations. This makes it so that the entire government is under the influence of international corporate executives, which destroys any chance of unbiased policymaking that has the interest of the public in mind. This also leads to an increase in income inequality, as the government cannot properly enforce it’s income distribution policies. The GINI index puts a number to the level of inequality. The US is a solid amount lower than Nigeria, even while having some of the highest inequality of developed countries.  The US sits at 40 while Nigeria sits at 48.   All of these factors lead to Nigeria’s democracy lacking functionality even though it shares it’s form with the United States.
