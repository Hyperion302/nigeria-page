    Lagos (the largest city in Nigeria), fits the Subsaharan Africa model.There are both a current CBD and a historical one on Lagos island, along with a large group of markets. As you move outwards, there are lots of suburbs with mixed levels of income and it drops quickly in levels of density on the outer edge.
