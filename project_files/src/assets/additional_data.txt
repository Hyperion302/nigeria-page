    The high dependence on oil that the Nigerian economy has created severe gaps in self dependence and sovereignty.  By making up 83% of exports, Nigeria is highly dependant on it’s export of oil to foreign countries.  This clearly classifies it as a rentier state.  Nigeria is also unable to consume its own resources, as it can only process 29% of the oil it processes.  Since Nigeria is unable to process its own oil it becomes heavily dependant on foreign entities such as MNCs purchasing it’s oil and refining it for them.  This heavy dependence gives MNCs and foreign governments a significant amount of policy making power that can at times override public interest.
